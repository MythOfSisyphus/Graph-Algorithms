## Introduction
As it is clear from the name of the repository that *it is for graph algorithms*. I heard the name of graph algorithms like *Dijkstra Algorithm, A\* Algorithm, DFS, BFS, Bellman Ford Algorithm* and many more and then I searched for these algorithm in order to learn about them then I got the beautifully structured course *Graph Theory with Python* on *Stack Abuse*. I read several articles there and those articles were really great and understandable so I thought why not make its repository and add some standard problems on it. That's the story of this repository.

## How to use this repository?
See I have tried my best to structure all the files. Folder *Course Material* contains all the algorithms and material which I learnt from *Stack Abuse*, Folder *My Attempts* contains many files of my attempt to write an algorithm which I used to try to write after reading *intro* on *Stack Abuse* and it also contains some explanation and comments which I think are essential and Folder *Standard Problems* contains some standard and non-standard problems on graph algorithms like *Topological Sorting, Cycle Detection, Path Finding, Maze Solving, etc.* So I would recommend you to first go through the *My Attempts* folder or read article on *Stack Abuse* before trying any problem or you read statement of all problems then think about how to solve them then read articles and learn about graph algorithm. This will really give you clear idea or motive about why we're learning these algorithms and why they're important.

## Contribution
I don't know if someone would contribute to my this little repository. Anyways but yeah, if you think, you can improve this repository by adding/correcting explanations, problems or anything else then please do. I would be glad to see your contribution in this. Happy Coding!
